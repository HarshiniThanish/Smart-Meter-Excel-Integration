🔌 Wiring and Circuit Connections
This smart energy meter project uses an ESP8266 NodeMCU and a PZEM-004T v3.0 sensor to measure real-time voltage, current, power, and energy. Below are the detailed connection instructions for setting up the circuit and logging data using PLX-DAQ in Excel.

🧠 Microcontroller
ESP8266 NodeMCU (e.g., ESP-12E)

📟 Sensor
PZEM-004T v3.0 (TTL version)

🔗 ESP8266 to PZEM-004T Wiring
NodeMCU Pin	GPIO	Connects To (PZEM Pin)	Purpose
D5	14	RX	Send data from ESP8266 to PZEM
D6	12	TX	Receive data from PZEM
GND	GND	GND	Common ground
Vin (5V)	Vin	Vcc	Power supply for the PZEM module

💡 Note: Since the PZEM-004T requires 5V power and NodeMCU operates at 3.3V logic, the PZEM should be powered from the Vin pin of the NodeMCU, which provides ~5V from the USB connection.

⚡ AC Load Connections
The AC side of the PZEM-004T connects to a regular home power supply:

L (Line) – Connect this to the live wire, ideally through a load like a bulb or fan.

N (Neutral) – Connect this to the neutral wire.

⚠️ Caution: This part involves direct AC voltage. Make sure to take proper safety precautions, insulate all terminals, and test only under supervision or with protection circuits.

🖥️ Excel Logging with PLX-DAQ
To record your sensor readings in Excel using PLX-DAQ, connect your NodeMCU to your PC via USB and follow these settings:

Select the correct COM port in PLX-DAQ (e.g., COM4 or COM5).

Set the baud rate to 9600 (matches the Serial.begin(9600) in code).

Data will appear in real time in Excel in the format defined by the code.

🔁 Recap of Wiring
D5 (GPIO14) → PZEM RX

D6 (GPIO12) → PZEM TX

Vin (5V) → PZEM Vcc

GND → PZEM GND

USB → Connects to PC for power and PLX-DAQ data logging

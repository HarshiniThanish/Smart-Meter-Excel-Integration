#  Smart Energy Meter using ESP8266, PZEM-004T and PLX-DAQ

This project implements a Smart Energy Meter that monitors real-time electrical parameters such as voltage, current, power, and energy using the **PZEM-004T v3.0** sensor and **ESP8266 NodeMCU**. A unique feature of this project is the use of **PLX-DAQ** for **offline Excel data logging**, which allows users to track power usage without internet connectivity. Firebase integration is currently in progress to enable cloud-based monitoring in future versions.

## ðŸ”— Circuit Connections

### ESP8266 to PZEM-004T:

| NodeMCU Pin | GPIO | PZEM Pin | Purpose |
|-------------|------|----------|---------|
| D5          | 14   | RX       | ESP â†’ PZEM data |
| D6          | 12   | TX       | PZEM â†’ ESP data |
| GND         | â€”    | GND      | Common ground |
| Vin         | â€”    | Vcc      | 5V power for PZEM |

>  Use the **Vin pin** (5V from USB) to power the PZEM-004T. Do not connect 5V directly to GPIOs.

### PZEM AC Wiring:

- **L (Line)** â€“ Connect to live wire through a load (e.g., bulb)
- **N (Neutral)** â€“ Connect to AC neutral

**Caution:** Use proper insulation and safety precautions while handling AC wiring.

##  Excel Logging with PLX-DAQ

- Connect the NodeMCU to your PC using a USB cable.
- Open the provided `PLX-DAQ-v2.11.xlsm` file in Excel.
- Enable Macros.
- Choose the correct COM port and set baud rate to `9600`.
- Data will begin logging in real-time into Excel with proper headers and values.
